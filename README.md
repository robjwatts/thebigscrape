# The Big Scrape -- A Gizmodo Web Scraper App!


## Today, we are going to scrape some articles from the popular tech blog, Gizmodo. We are using Cheerio to scrape the site, and Mongoose to store the information.  

### First, we run our server:

### When we load the page, we can see the results being logged...
